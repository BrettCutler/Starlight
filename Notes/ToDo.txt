TODO
----------------
* Racquet can miss target during swing
  * IN TESTING
  * Problem is rotating at root: animation gets wildly offset
  * Fixed by player 

* Racquet body is losing zero position again...

* Build better tile patterns
  * Move left, right
  * Advance on player

* Add player-triggered racquet swing
  * Added early implementation, but
    * Can't tell if successfully activated swing
    * Research Cosmic Smash to see how this work: does it trigger "ready" anim?

* Add 'lurching' target advancement option -- space-invaders-esque, on beat events

* Get power shot working
  * Turns all targets into Trigger colliders?

* Expend combo meter
  * When power shot triggered
  * When combo target explodes
  * Rename: 'glimmer' or something

[X] Get spawned combo trigger target
  * moves in sinusoidal pattern, glows orange, when hit explodes nearby tiles
  [X] no, moves in ricochet pattern, so it's predictable over longer period

* Clean up code: ball OnCollision
  * Organize logic for code reuse, expandibility for new target types

[X] Add HSV color support

[X] Add Color extensions for slerping, piecewise conversion to HSL (see colorx)

[X] Implement more robust delays
  * Get beat delay on hit target
  * Delay on back wall
  * Delay on walls

[X] Add ability to swap ball speed between OnBeat, OnOddBeat
  * adjust delay timers in GameBallCharacterController

* To cover initial impact and delayed sound effects discrepancy, does it help to:
  * Upon un-synced impact, play fill sound (how sharp of an attack?)
    * Fill sound duration is about one default wait (half-beat)
    * We don't cut it at release point, we just let it play
  * Upon sync & release, play hit sound (definitely sharp attack)

[X] Add beat-synced color changes
  * tile court grid - disco color change
    * change palette, speed as intensity increases

* Add basic menu
  * title screen
  * simple options
    * start game
    * exit
    * toggle: auto-swing
    * ball speed (on beat, on odd beat)
    * toggle: forced racquet delay, or only when needed
    * toggle: activated combo (display button), or target combo
    * toggle: use shatterable targets
    * toggle: combo increment on hit racquet or target
  * identical to pause screen?
  * [esc] or button to pause
    * restart
    * exit=

* Add sophisticated tag system

* Clean up code
  * Comment
  * Remove unnecessary variables
  * Organize file structure
  * Don't do work on Awake when it could be serialized

[X] Get Trigger target tiles working

[X] Get countdown to count to 4

[X] Racquet position not getting properly reset after certain swings

[X] Ball is not bouncing high enough
  * Fixed by adjusting input of original bounce into bounceback

[X] Add option for testing racquet swing accuracy:
  * "auto-x-position for racquet swing"
    * for more accurate test, update x-Pos to ball's every frame during swing states

[X] Fix racquet being set to middle of court for  swing

[X] Light analog stick horizontal movement results in reversed movement
  * i.e., if h.magnitude < .2, x+ becomes x-, vice-versa

[X] If ball is bouncing up (yVel > 0 ) and hits racquet angle up, it can bounce off racquet into -z, going out of bounds
  * Fix animation taking precedence over angle clamping by putting angle clamp adjustment into root, not body
  * REDO THIS: ball seems safe now, but player has too little, too inconsistent control over ball placement

[X] Add screen shake

[X] Add option for beat delay on hit:
  * racquet
  * wall
  * target

* Transition between songs
  * no gameplay interruption
  * highlight earlier score
  * shift colors
  * change art? (no art yet...)

* tie object color to level palette theme
  * can change as song, song mood change

[X] Racquet swing not moving properly in z,y
  * Animation blending settings angry again, most likely
    * Moving the height anim up to the top layer (so it's not blending at all with the swing) fixed this
    * The cost: height anim will stomp any other input to y,z pos during swing
      * But I'm not doing this, so it should be ok

[X] Why isn't racquet being properly set to zPos specified in GameManager?
  * This was clamping position to bounds using Vector2 assignment, which set z=0

[X] COROUTINE is not precise enough to track quarter beats. Check if it's precise enough to track half-beats
  * We can still predic when a quarter, eighth beat will happen or say when it did -- fractionalizing beatDuration works fine
  * But we can't seem to run events based on it
    * unless:
      * WaitForMusicManager updates every frame, checks if enough time has passed, trips a beat event?

* For racquet anim swing prediction:
  * getting a longer lead spaces out the anim
  *  but, it risks the ball colliding with a surface after estimate -- screwing up the estimate
  * Therefore, if we've already initiated the swing, and we collide with something, reset the estimate

[X] Prevent ball from rolling on bottom
  * How to do this? either:
    * Set y velocity off of racquet swing -- and adjusted by racquet angle
    [X] Create minimum y velocity off of bottom pane
      * Doing this -- it appears to be what Cosmic Smash does, and fake physics is likely more noticeable if applied to player's racquet

[X] WaitForMusicManager conversion to predicting beat events
  * OnBeat is recording predicted times, but triggering off first Update past canonical time
  * OnDefault isn't using canonical time, is responsive still

[X] Issues with physics:
  [X] why is my estimate of when the ball will return to the racquet off of beatTime by so much (by about .122s)?
    --- the time estimate is wrong, it is hitting the racquet at approximately the right time (probably correct frame)
      -- so is the error in Distance to Racquet or time to cover distance?
  [X] why is estimate of ball impact racquet point incorrect (by about -.4y)?
    --- this is because of incorrect racquet position + print statement of ball position occuring a frame later
  [X] when ball reaches "nearRacquet", why is my estimate on when it will hit the racquet off by ten frames?

[X] gravity & paddle swing
  * ball < 2.5z, initiate swing timed to projected impact time?
  * neutral swing is somewhat up (20 degrees?)?
  * make sure ball can't lose height inside level
    * is this done just by assuring height + angle from launch?
      * is height + angle snapped to a few values that we know work?



* Get player racquet moving with character controller implementation
  * Use box to check location, instead of sphere
  * Make sure it doesn't move in z direction, ever
  * How does self-rotation effect colliion?

* controller support system
  * look at version used in Galak-Z
  * must meet: 360 + generic controllers, PC, Mac, Linux

* Frequency map to 

* Consistent double reflections when ball hits racquet -- fixable!

* Add warning or lock system if movement goes beyond what we can resolve (vel*dt > radius)

* Implement WaitForMoveContinue locks on movement
  * On racquet
  * On ball
    - do it by implementing settor on m_WaitForMoveContinue to make rigidbody kinematic, save old velocity

* Add an input manager
  * Look into "InControl", Galak-Z is using it

* Build scoring system
  * combo for multiple hits

* Build editor for block patterns

* Transition between levels
